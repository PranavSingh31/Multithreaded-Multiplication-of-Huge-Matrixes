# Multithreaded Multiplication of Huge Matrixes

## **What is Multithreading**
Multithreading is a programming concept that allows multiple threads (smaller units of execution) to run concurrently within a single process. Each thread can perform a different task and share resources such as memory, files, and network connections with other threads in the same process. Multithreading is used to improve the performance of applications that need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, by allowing the processor to switch between threads and execute them in parallel. It is commonly used in applications that require heavy processing or user interface interaction, such as web servers, database management systems, and video games.

## **Why multiplication of 2D-matrices with higher dimension is a difficult job?**
